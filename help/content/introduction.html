    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      This section provides a general overview of the application, its purpose,
      and the core concepts you need to understand to use it effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>What is this Application?</h2>
    <p>The System Mapper Tool is a standalone applictaion to provide users a visual representation of other wormhole systems. Essentially it can be used to draw a tactical picture of the system and its associated wormholes, along with their distannce and location. The user can also add notes to the system, such as the location of a citadel or other important structures through the use custom markers </p>
    <p>
      The user can also add D-Scans from the in game D-Scanner, then using this data, can mark:
      <UL>
        <LI>Their location, and any subsequent location (Trilateration).</LI>
        <LI>Threat Analysis of ships, structures, and other entities in the system</LI>
        <LI>Provide context of the D-Scan origin by the use of range adjustable D-Scan circles</LI>
        <LI>Help locate potential targets and targets by the use of a D-Scan functionality</LI>
      </UL><BR>

       The user can also add Copies fro the probe window, then using this data, can mark: 
        <UL>
            <LI>Potential sites (Combat, Relic, Data, Gas and Ore)</LI>
            <LI>Can then link them to custom markers</LI>
            <LI>Can check if the site is within the D-Scan circle of other system objects</LI>
            <LI>Help locate potential targets and targets, in conjunction with the Threat Analysis functionality</LI>
      </UL><BR>

        <p>
            The key functionality is the ability to save the system map, and then load it later, or to paste the generated link and allow other users to see the system map and tactical picture you have created.This allows users to maintain a record of their system maps, which can be useful for future reference or for sharing with other users.

        </p>
        <p>
            In built into this is the functionality to display recent system kills on loading system.This functionality is built on the back of the ESI API, and allows users to see the most recent kills in the system, and their location on the map. This can be useful for identifying potential targets or threats in the system.
        </p>
    <p> 
      The application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing
      users to quickly create and manage their system maps.
