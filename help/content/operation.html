    <h1>Operation</h1>
    <p>
      This section provides a general overview of the application operation, its prequisites,
      and the core concepts you need to understand to use it effectively.
    </p>
    <h2>prequisites</h2>
    <p></p>
    Most of prequisites invove D-Scan and Overview in game, and without these in place you will not get the full benefit of the application.
    </p>
    <h3>D-Scan Prerequesites</h3>
    <p>
        To use the location in system functionality, you will need to have the D-Scan window open in game, and have the D-Scan range set to a value that is appropriate for the system you are in. This is typically set to 14.3 AU for most systems, but can be adjusted as needed. To use Trilateration, you will also need to have a filter set up that will display Celestial Objects(only planets).
    </p>
    <p>
        To use manual Trilateration, you need to have an overview tab setup that shows Celestial Objects. This functionality allows you to manually select the Celestial Objects in the system, and then use the overview range to calculate your location in space.
